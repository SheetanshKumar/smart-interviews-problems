You have created an army of robots at the robotics lab in your college. Each robot has a strength of Ri. When you showcase your robots in an exhibition, a visitor passes by and asks you to display different combination strengths of your robotic army. At this time, you start wondering what is the smallest strength army which cannot be constructed using your robots.

Input Format

First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by 2T lines, the first line of test case contains N - the number of robots and the next line contains the strength of the robots.

Constraints

20 points
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 20
0 <= Ri <= 100

80 points
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 10000
0 <= Ri <= 1000

Output Format

For each test case, print the smallest strength army which cannot be constructed using your robots, separated by newline.
